CS 12: Section 9, *Introduction to Prototyping* is a 3-unit, pass/fail  course I designed taught in Winter term that provides a low-stakes, novel opportunity to learn about prototyping. The course’s objectives are twofold; (i) to provide a stepping stone to more advanced robotics, mechanics, and computer science courses for students of any major, and (ii) to provide real, applicable experience in prototyping and design.

*Introduction to Prototyping* will provide a low-stakes, multidisciplinary experience in robotics that students may use to guage their interest in robotics. This 3-unit pass/fail course will enable students to prepare for SURFs and internships during the school year without disrupting their regular academic schedule. This is especially important for Caltech undergraduates, who are often the most common applicants for SURFs, as it enables them to gain practical prototyping experience while satisfying their important major requirements. *Introduction to Prototyping* will also provide a stepping stone to more advanced clubs, research and classes on campus.

Student feedback
======
Many of the students who completed the Caltech course feedback survey (TQFR) left positive views and constructive suggestions for future iterations of the class. Below are a selection of them–for more details, please refer to the TQFR file linked here. Note that these testimonials highlight the need for a low-stakes prototyping course, and that last year’s iteration of the course fulfilled those needs. The positive feedback has greatly inspired me to continue teaching the course and improve upon it.

*“Would definitely recommend this class, and I hope it is taught in the future. I always wanted to learn how to use a pico, and I accomplished this goal. You also get to build up to a cool final project.”*

*“This is a really good course to be familiar with microcontrollers. I've taken EE/ME 7 that taught me about circuits and different components, but it was just way too hard for someone who just wants to learn how to build hobby projects.”*

*“Well taught and not too much of a burden time-wise.”*
