Welcome!
======
I am a first-year doctoral student at Georgia Tech ([IRIM](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics)) 
in the [Dynamic Mobility Lab](https://dynamicmobility.github.io/), supported by
the IRIM and NSF fellowships and advised by Prof. [Maegan Tucker](https://maegantucker.com/). Broadly, I want to develop human-robot teams that 
can think, act, and recover in real-world dynamic enviornments. To this end, I draw
upon methods in ML/AI, control theory, and classical robotics. Please browse my
[publications](https://njanwani.github.io/publications/) and [portfolio](https://njanwani.github.io/portfolio/)
pages for more information on my work in exoskeletons, assistive/autonomous driving, 
arms, and more!

Previously, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at Caltech, working with Prof.
Joel Burdick and Prof. Aaron Ames on assistive robotics and intention-aware
safety-critical control. In my free time, I like to ski, make music, and build
RC vehicles.

My interests
======
My research interests include *human robot interaction*, *human-in-the-loop
learning*, and *safety-critical control*. I aim to design
robotic systems that safely, and seamlessly, interact
with human collaborators by fusing intelligent intention estimation via artificial
intelligence with the formal guarantees of safety-critical control. Some areas I
hope to continue studying are reinforcement learning, large language and vision
models, and nonlinear control. 

I am also committed to increasing the accessibility to robotics to incoming scientists
and engineers of any background as I have found robots provide an exceptional
opportunity to teach robust software design, multi-disciplinary problem solving,
and the importance of team collaboration.

My work and research
======
I currently conduct research with Dr. Joel Burdick at Caltech and at Caltech's
Amber Lab with Dr. Aaron Ames. With Dr. Burdick, I am investigating *intention-based
safety critical control*, where I have implemented a framework to tune robust
safety filters with machine learning methods that estimate an operator's intention.
I am currently researching reinforcement learning methods to integrate specific
operator preferences into the framework, as well as generalize it to multiple
robotic platforms.

With Dr. Ames, I am developing an ankle exoskeletal device that utilizes a novel
actuation technique, requiring custom solutions for problems like operator gait
phase estimation and control architecture. I am currently conducting human trials
to evaluate the exoskeleton's efficacy in reducing energy expenditure while walking.

I also teach robotics at Caltech, with a specific interest in increasing accessibility
to robotics in my community. To accomplish this, I have designed and taught a course on
robotic prototyping for research, and implemented a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)
robotics course. I am also a teaching assistant for several robotics and computer science
courses at Caltech. -->
