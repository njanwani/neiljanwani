Recent advancements in flexible materials provide potential mechanisms towards transforming powered ankle exoskeletons from being heavy and rigid towards being lightweight and flexible. Specifically, this work presents a novel ankle exoskeleton that utilizes a pair of handed shearing auxetics coupled with compression springs. This flexible mechanism converts rotation into a linear displacement, effectively changing the stiffness of the spring during the walking gait. By controlling this stiffness properly, the ankle exoskeleton achieves lower muscle activity during toe push-off.
