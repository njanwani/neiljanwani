For a quadruped robot, path planning presents a unique challenge. For an
autonomous car, one needs to consider constraints like the size of the robot for
avoiding obstacles and wheel size for turning radius. Compared to these systems,
a quadruped contains more choices for a single action due to the high number of
DOFs in the system. For example, a quadruped requires one to plan foot placement
when moving from one location to another, which must be repeated for each leg,
as well as assigning specific locations to four legs within areas of possible
placement. Thus, it is easy to see that the dimensionality of the problem
increases greatly along with the complexity of a local planner, thus requiring
unique planning methods. This project seeks to implement a path planning
algorithm for a quadruped robot on a simplified terrain model consisting of
discrete allowed foot locations (“pegs”) with motion constrained by leg lengths
and geometry. In this video, we discuss the implementation of a hierarchical
planner for navigating this quadruped over terrain with both random and 
patterned valid foot placements.
