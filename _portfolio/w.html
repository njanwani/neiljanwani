For a path planning system, one must consider the myriad of trade-offs when
selecting the algorithmic approach to navigating your environment. Your approach
is also heavily dependent on your prior knowledge of the map and the ability to
detect any unexpected discrepancies in the map. As such, in this report, we will
explore these very trade-offs with the following algorithms: Dijkstra, A*, and
D*. This exploration will be conducted in partially known environments where
obstacles are discovered as the robot executes the planned path; consequently
replanning needs to occur in order to navigate the robot to completely to the 
goal.
