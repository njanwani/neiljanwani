All robots and systems are subject to a variety of limitations. When in a
restrictive environment, the robot will have to contend with the sensor readings
being less reliable. As such, additional algorithms and methodologies have to be
applied in order to handle the extreme edge cases that will appear due to
accumulated error. This project seeks to address this topic by sending a
two-wheel drive robot equipped with encoders, a gyro, and an Intel Realsense
camera (shown in Figure 1 below) through a myriad of pathways consisting of
unknown obstacles while avoiding collisions and ultimately arriving at a goal
point in a map.
