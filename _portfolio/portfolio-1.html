Quadruped locomotion presents a challenge in that it requires manipulating and
coordinating four independent appendages which combine in a robot with a large
number of DOFs. Such a task expands on concepts we learned in class this term,
such as driving lone arms, dealing with rigid obstacles, and using secondary
tasks to manipulate within the null space of our kinematic chain. This project
seeks to implement and control a quadruped robot within ROSâ€™s Rviz to walk with
a generalized gait and maneuver in-place. In this paper, we create a URDF for
our quadruped, formulate our kinematic chains through which to control the
robot, and ultimately explore our goals of walking and maneuvering using various
trajectories while visualizing in Rviz.
